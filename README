Structure of the project

--> preprocessing.py deals with the preprocessing stage of the method (read the code and comments);
--> generateMasks.py deals with the generation of binary masks of the annotations and creates an auxiliar file that will be useful during training in creating the set of samples of interest;
--> mainLoop.py is the loop used to train the system for all the folds with validation included;
--> pytorch_util includes auxiliary functions that are called in the mainLoop.py;
--> pytorchClasses.py includes classes derived from Pytorch Objects used to load data faster as well as our Custom U-Net implementation that adds a BatchNormalization layer and a Sigmoid Layer at the beginning and end of the U-Net (defined in unet.py);
--> debugVisualResults helped in generating and visualizing intermediate results;
--> generateLearningCurve.py and testFolds.py were used to collect results.
